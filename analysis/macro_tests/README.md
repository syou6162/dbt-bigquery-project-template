# Tests of custom dbt macros
The directory contains tests of custom dbt macros, because it is hard to implement unit tests of dbt macros at the time of writing the documentation.
Instead of unit tests, calling custom macros in analysis would be great.
Even though it doesn't all requirements of custom dbt macros, we are able to check if it works or not when compiling the dbt project.
